# InvoxAI — Copy Rewrite Prompt

## The Problem With the Current Copy

The current copy leans too heavily toward "bespoke AI systems" and freelance integration work. Reading the hero and problem section, a visitor would think InvoxAI is a generic AI consultancy — not a company with a specific, tangible product (AI inbound agents for trade businesses). The freelance work is important but secondary. The site needs to lead with the concrete thing we do, then expand into the broader offering.

## Positioning Hierarchy

Structure ALL copy around this priority order:

1. **PRIMARY (60% of emphasis):** We build AI voice and chat agents that handle inbound enquiries for trade businesses — answering calls, qualifying leads, booking jobs. This is the hero, the first thing anyone reads, the thing that makes a plumber on his van stop scrolling.

2. **SECONDARY (25% of emphasis):** We also help trade businesses modernise their operations with AI — CRM automation, job scheduling, quote generation, follow-up sequences, workflow automation. This is the freelance/integration arm. Frame it as a natural extension: "Once your inbound is sorted, we can automate the rest."

3. **TERTIARY (15% of emphasis):** We're UK-based, we understand trades, we speak plainly, ongoing support. Trust signals and differentiators.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

- **Write for a tradesperson, not a tech founder.** The reader is a plumber sitting in his van at 6pm, tired, wondering why he missed three calls today. He doesn't care about "bespoke systems" or "AI revolution." He cares about not losing jobs.
- **Be direct and confident.** Short sentences. No hedging. Say what we do, say why it matters, move on.
- **Avoid:** "bespoke", "tailored", "revolution", "cutting-edge", "leverage", "empower", "unlock", "seamless", "transform your business". These are empty words that every AI company uses.
- **Use instead:** Plain, concrete language. "We answer your calls." "You stop missing jobs." "It works while you're on site."
- **British English** throughout — "organised" not "organized", "enquiries" not "inquiries", etc.
- **The gold italic text** in headings is for the emotional punch — the payoff line. Use it for the part that makes the reader feel something.

## Section-by-Section Rewrite

### HERO SECTION

The hero must answer three questions in 5 seconds: What do you do? Who is it for? Why should I care?

**Current (too vague, too freelance-focused):**
> "No two businesses are the same. Your systems shouldn't be either."

**Direction:** Lead with the inbound agent product. The headline should make a tradesperson immediately think "that's me, I need that." Reference the specific pain (missed calls, lost jobs) and the specific solution (AI answers for you).

Something in the territory of:
- "Your next customer is calling. Let AI answer."
- "Stop missing calls. Start winning jobs."
- "Every missed call is a lost job. We fix that."

The italic gold text should be the emotional payoff — the bit that reframes the problem.

**Subheadline:** One sentence that explains the product concretely. Mention: voice/chat agents, inbound enquiries, trade businesses, automatic. Then a second sentence that hints at broader capabilities without overshadowing the core product.

**Example direction (not final copy — write something better):**
> "We build AI agents that answer your calls, qualify your leads, and book your jobs — automatically. Plus wider AI integration to streamline the rest of your operations."

### SOCIAL PROOF STRIP (below hero)

Keep the stats in monospace. Make them specific to inbound:
- Leads captured (number)
- Answer rate or qualification rate (percentage)
- Availability (24/7)

Add a one-liner like "Trusted by electricians, plumbers, and trade businesses across the UK" — grounded, specific.

### PROBLEM SECTION

**Current (too generic, reads like an AI consultancy):**
> "Generic tools weren't built for the way you work."

This is too abstract. A plumber doesn't think about "generic tools" — he thinks about missed calls, unanswered voicemails, and spending his evenings doing admin instead of resting.

**Direction:** Split this into two clear halves — Problem (left) and Solution (right), which the current layout already does.

**Problem side — make it visceral and specific:**
The pain points should be things a tradesperson has literally experienced today:
- You're on a job and your phone rings. You can't answer. The customer calls someone else.
- You check your voicemail at 6pm. Three messages. Two have already booked elsewhere.
- You spend your evenings quoting, chasing, and doing admin instead of switching off.
- You thought about hiring someone to answer calls but it's £25k+ a year.

Frame these as real scenarios, not abstract bullet points. Use "you" language.

**Solution side — lead with inbound, then expand:**
The solution should directly address each pain point:
- Every call answered instantly, 24/7 — even when you're on the roof
- Leads qualified and details captured before you even see the notification  
- Jobs booked into your calendar automatically
- And beyond inbound: we automate your quoting, follow-ups, and admin too

The key transition here is: "First, we make sure you never miss a lead. Then, we help you automate everything else." This naturally introduces the freelance/integration work as a second step, not the main pitch.

### SERVICES SECTION ("What We Build" or "What We Do")

Three cards, but reorder and reframe:

**Card 1: AI Inbound Agents (the star)**
Voice and chat agents that answer your calls, qualify leads, capture job details, and book appointments — 24/7. Works with your existing phone number. Sounds natural, handles complex enquiries, and sends you a summary of every interaction.

This card should have the most copy and visual weight.

**Card 2: AI Operations & Automation (the freelance/integration work)**
Frame this NOT as "freelance AI work" (which sounds like a contractor) but as an extension of the inbound product: "Once your inbound is handled, we automate the rest." CRM integration, automated quoting, follow-up sequences, job scheduling, customer communications. Bespoke to how your business actually runs.

**Card 3: Ongoing Support & Optimisation**  
We don't build and disappear. Continuous refinement based on real call data. Monthly reporting. New features as your business grows.

### HOW IT WORKS

Keep the numbered steps. The copy should be short and punchy — one sentence per step, maybe two max. Make step 1-3 about the inbound agent setup, and step 4 hint at broader work:

01 → We learn how your business works — your services, your area, your process  
02 → We build a custom AI agent trained on your specific business  
03 → We test it with real scenarios until it handles enquiries like your best employee  
04 → Your agent goes live. You start capturing every lead. Then we look at what else we can automate.

### WHY US / DIFFERENTIATORS

Keep this brief. 3-4 short statements:
- Built specifically for trades — not generic AI that's been repurposed
- UK-based team that understands how trade businesses actually operate
- No jargon, no long contracts, no nonsense
- From inbound agents to full operations automation — one team, one relationship

### CTA SECTION (bottom of page)

Lead with the inbound product:
> "Ready to stop missing calls?"
or
> "Your customers are calling. Let's make sure someone answers."

Secondary line can reference the broader offering:
> "Whether you need an AI agent handling your inbound or a complete operations overhaul, we'll start with a free consultation to figure out exactly what you need."

### CONTACT FORM

Keep the current structure but make the heading specific:
> "Let's talk about your business"

The "What type of trade?" dropdown is good — keep it. Consider adding a radio or dropdown: "What are you most interested in?" with options like:
- AI agent for inbound calls
- Wider AI automation for my business  
- Both / not sure yet

This helps you qualify leads AND signals to the visitor that you do both things.

## Copy Principles Checklist

Before finalising any copy, check against these:

- [ ] Would a plumber in his van understand this in 5 seconds?
- [ ] Does the hero clearly communicate "we answer your calls with AI"?
- [ ] Is inbound the dominant theme on the page, with freelance/integration as the clear second offering?
- [ ] Is every sentence earning its place, or is it filler?
- [ ] Have we avoided every word on the banned list (bespoke, tailored, seamless, etc.)?
- [ ] Does the gold italic text in each heading deliver an emotional punch?
- [ ] Is the copy in British English throughout?
- [ ] Would this page make someone pick up the phone or fill in the form?

## What the Page Should Feel Like After the Rewrite

A tradesperson lands on this page and within 5 seconds thinks: "These lot answer my calls for me using AI. That's exactly what I need." They scroll down, see the problem section and think "yeah, that's my life." They see the solution and think "that would be brilliant." They see the services and realise we also do broader automation work — bonus. They hit the contact form and fill it in.

The freelance/integration work should feel like discovering a bonus feature, not the main pitch. "Oh, they do that too? Even better." Not "wait, what do they actually do?"
